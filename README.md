### Source Code

```
This is not a full-blown tutorial, rather a step-by-step approach using my time-tested procedures. Take it for what it is meant to be: just a bit of advice. I am not trying to preach any specific coding standards or habits, rather making suggestions on what could make your life somewhat easier when it comes to leaky code. What I describe works extremely well for me & it might for some of you too.
The above being said, the approach described in the attached does not use 3rd party tools and does not use advanced memory dumps and other similar resources. If you have access to professional tools, by all means use them, if you don't, then this might be of some help.
Note any comments/feedback below left by others from their experiences, maybe those apply too.
